#summary A breakdown of the character sheets

== Breakdown of character sheets ==

this page will contain information about character generation for player characters (and some NPCs and enemies)

=== Character Generation ===

at the start of the game, the player will pick what character class they want from a list. unlike other RPGS where classes are restrictive, mazecraft classes are only a "starting setup" consisting of "rolled" stats, resistances, and a starting kit.

=== Stat Rolling ===

8 individual numbers are taken from 3D6 rolls. the numbers are applied to the character stats in the stat placement order. players are then given (6?) extra points that can be applied to the stat points in order to provide a degree of customization


=== Character Classes ===
|| Class Name || Stat Placement Order || starting kit ||
|| Psychic || (Int) (Dex) (Cha) (Ag) (Con)(Str)|| Psychic Hat, Random Wand ||
|| Assassin || (Dex) (Ag) (Str) (Int) (Con) (Cha)|| Assassin Shoes, Random Pistol ||
|| Marine || (Str) (Dex) (Ag) (Cha) (Int) (Con) || Marine Helmet, Random Melee ||
|| Hacker || (Dex) (Int) (Con) (Cha) (Str) (Ag) || Hacker Pants, Knife, Random Inf-Use Item ||

=== Rollable Character Stats ===

|| shortform || full name || effects || bonuses || drawbacks ||
|| (Ag) || Agility || dodge, move || .. || .. ||
|| (Dex) || Dexterity || attack speed, tech success || .. || .. ||
|| (Str) || Strength || melee damage || .. || .. ||
|| (Cha) || Charisma || buying / selling || .. || .. ||
|| (Int) || Intelligence || magic damage || .. || .. ||
|| (Con) || Constitution || encumberment and base resistances || .. || .. ||

=== Other Character Stats ===
*(non-rollable, effected by other stats and items)*

|| shortform || full name || effects || bonuses || drawbacks ||
|| (Mov) || Movement Speed || Ag and Enc are used to determine the run speed of the character || .. || .. ||
|| (EnM) || Encumberment Maximum || the maximum weight possibly carried by a character (determined by Con and items) || .. || .. ||
|| (Enc) || Encumberment || the current weight % carried of total (used to effect Ag and Mov once a % is reached) || .. || .. ||
|| (CaC) || Cast Chance || weight of worn items and Enc are used to determine percentage accuracy/chance of success for magic attacks || .. || .. ||
|| (ABR) || Attack Bonus : Ranged || Dex and items are used to determine ranged accuracy/dmg bonus || .. || .. ||
|| (ABM) || Attack Bonus : Melee || Str and items are used to determine melee dmg bonus || .. || .. ||

although these stats are not rollable or directly alterable, they can still be effected by items.

=== Resistances ===

resistance determines how much of a % of damage done by a source will be resisted by the target.

base resistance is determined by constitution; if you have 11 Con, then you have a base resistance of all damage types of 11%.

resistances can be raised by gaining experience and putting points into Con, or by equipping items with resistance bonuses.
