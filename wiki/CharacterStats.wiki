=== Character Generation ===

at the start of the game, the player will pick what character class they want from a list. unlike other RPGS where classes are restrictive, mazecraft classes are only a "starting setup" consisting of "rolled" stats, resistances, and a starting kit.

=== Resistances ===

resistance determines how much of a % of damage done by a source will be resisted by the target.

base resistance is determined by constitution; if you have 11 Con, then you have a base resistance of all damage types of 11%.

resistances can be raised by gaining experience and putting points into Con, or by equipping items with resistance bonuses.
