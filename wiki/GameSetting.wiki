#summary Backstory of the world, nations and characters of Mazecraft.

== Historical Deviation ==

in ancient histories there were always tales of far-off lands across the great oceans; championed by mystics and dismissed by serious scholars, these tales indicated a long-forgotten and faraway civilization from before a great flood and cataclysm that cut them off from the known world forever.

driven by the idea of a spherical earth, explorers from spain and portugal attempted to circumnavigate the planet, in order to avoid the harsh and hostile route to asia around africa. arriving in the new world after crossing the atlantic, these explorers were in for a shock : not only had they arrived at a previously unknown continent, but they had arrived at the same time as explorers from an unknown land lying far to the west across the pacific; not the asians they had expected, but a yet unknown culture of extreme wisdom and ingenuity.

== Progression of Technology ==

the world was not a sphere as thought; it was an endless plane stretching forever from east to west horizon; populated endlessly by continents unknown to our own civilization.

much like our own colonial ways, the inhabitants of these faraway lands pressed outwards to conquer and chart our lands; resulting in countless wars and skirmishes. a shaky parity was achieved as the powers and pressures of each civilization squashed against eachother; like an endless game of risk stretching to infinity, no empire dared move against another for a fear of being blindsided by still another in return

unlike our modern times, where development and industry is limited only by the finite number of minds to drive us forward; this alternative world provides an infinite number of minds with limited resources; most technology remains locked to a medieval level but citizens commonly will witness feats of high technology such as armoured walkers and mysterious computing machines (created by individual and brilliant artisans rather than a manufacturing process)

technology diffuses between the empires as traders make the long voyage from continent to continent, driving development in strange and unexpected directions.

beyond even the technology developped by the existing empires; there remain evidences of a long-lost world-spanning civilization, capable of boundless feats of magic and technology. caches of their technology, known as dungeons, can be found and explored by intrepid adventurers, at a huge risk but with the chance of great profit.

== Current Known World Status ==

without globalization and due to constant pressure from outside sources, beyond colonial times there has been little in the way of alliance and cooperation between nations of the known world beyond individual contracts of trade and non-aggression

rulers of the tiny feudal dukedoms scramble amongst each-other to raise the level of their empires technology and defenses both against known enemies and the unknown forces lurking across the oceans

== The Institute ==

what began as a fundamentalist religion that championed the idea of a flat earth became widely recognized as a source of truth once the true nature of our world was revealed.

unlike the small, fragmented nations of the known world, the institute spans all countries as a religious/scholarly/mercenary force.

the institute demands purity of genetics, keeping the genotypes of the known world as a sealed system, as well as purity of technology and knowledge; they discourage any exploration and movement outside of the known world as vehemently as they despise and distrust those from other faraway lands

== Salvaging and Adventuring ==

despite the influence of the institute, dukes and lords of the known world realize the significance of sending out adventurers to uncharted lands; even a single discovery of an unknown technology could raise the quality of life in their lands a thousandfold. these forays into the unknown are poorly documented; officially non-existant, these missions are the bread and butter of tales in alehouses and inns across the known world

children are brought up with the superstitions of the age; they all know the tales of the lands across the oceans, and the tales of storied adventurers and explorers. each child wishes to emulate the actions of men such as Columbus, the first man to bring microchips and nuclear isotopes back to the king of portugal before being eaten by a giant robotic spider

this is the role taken by mazecraft players; to go as a team into unknown territory; to find great riches and treasures; and to survive to tell the tale.
